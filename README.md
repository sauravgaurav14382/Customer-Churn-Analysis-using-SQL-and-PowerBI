📊 Project Overview  This project focuses on analyzing Customer Churn for a telecom company using SQL for data preprocessing and Power BI for building an interactive, insight-driven dashboard. The goal is to identify why customers are leaving and provide data-backed recommendations to improve retention and reduce churn.


# Customer-Churn-Analysis-using-SQL-and-PowerBI

**Overview**

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of customer churn in a telecommunications company, incorporating SQL and Power BI for data visualization and analysis. A Random Forest model, developed in Google Colab, is used to predict churn, providing actionable insights for reducing customer turnover.

**Key Objectives**

1. **Churn Analysis - Summary:** Visualize churn trends and customer demographics in Power BI.
2. **Churn Prediction:** Predict customer churn using a machine learning model.
  
**Tools and Technologies**

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI
* **Machine Learning:** Python, Google Colab (Random Forest Classifier)
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
  
**Model Development**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Removed irrelevant columns and label-encoded categorical features.
* **Model Training:** Trained a Random Forest Classifier on customer data to predict churn.
* **Prediction:** Used encoded data to predict churn status, exporting results for integration into Power BI.
  
**Project Structure**

* **SQL Queries:** Data extraction and transformation.
* **Power BI Dashboard:** Visual insights into customer churn trends.
* **Prediction Script:** Google Colab notebook for churn predictions.
